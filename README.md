## How to Launch Server

To launch the server, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the `server/` directory.
   ```bash
   npm i 
   node server.js
   ```
2. Navigate to the `client/` directory.
   ```bash
    npm i
    npm start
    ```
3. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.
4. You can now use the application.

## How to Use the Application
  There is no direct links to the pages.
    You can navigate to the pages by clicking on the links in the navbar for all components that are just made for testing backend.

You can navigate to:
- `http://localhost:4200/home` to access the home page.
- `http://localhost:4200/login` to access the login page.
- `http://localhost:4200/register` to access the register page.
- `http://localhost:4200/post-questions` to have access to navbar for all other components.

Nothing is backend related in the frontend. The backend is in the server folder.
